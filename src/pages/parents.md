We believe that a childâ€™s education is primarily a parental responsibility. Parents/carers therefore commit their support to both the management and maintenance of the School at all levels, and to sacrificial giving of prayer, time and finance.

Parents are always welcome in the School and take a full part in supervising playtimes, listening to reading and even contributing personal skills in lessons and activities. We find adult involvement to have a very positive effect in the classroom.
